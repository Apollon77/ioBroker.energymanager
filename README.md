# ioBroker.energymanager
=================

This adapter is a ment to read values from the E.ON Energymanager into ioBroker. Maybe it could work with the Solarwatt manager, because it should be the same thing with another name.

If the Solarwatt manager uses other urls than the E.ON one, it should be easy to adapt. Help or hints are welcome.

## Steps 
1. Install the adpater

2. Grab the values out of the your energymanger.[x]-object.
